# LDES Pipeline Development Notes

## Why This Project Exists

After manually tracking LDES announcements for investment research, I hit a wall. Regulatory filings are inconsistent, press releases bury the key specs, and international projects use different conventions. I needed to process 100+ documents quarterly to track the LDES market effectively.

**The breaking point:** Trying to analyze Q3 2024 LDES announcements manually took me 40+ hours. Too many missed projects, too much inconsistency in the data I captured.

## Technical Evolution

### **Initial Approach (Didn't Work)**

**Attempt 1: Pure regex extraction**
- Thought I could pattern-match capacity specs like "100 MW" and "4 hours"
- Reality: Energy storage regulatory language is too variable
- Example failure: "battery facility with 100 megawatts of power and four hours of duration" → regex missed this entirely

**Attempt 2: Generic financial/business NER models**
- Tried using standard spaCy business models 
- Missed energy-specific terminology consistently
- "Long duration energy storage" got tagged as generic "duration" entity
- "Form Energy" got confused with "form" (document type)

**Attempt 3: Standard news scraping approaches**
- Focused on press releases and news articles
- Missed the regulatory PDF filings where the real project details live
- FERC filings and state regulatory documents have the complete project specs

### **Current Architecture (What Actually Works)**

**Custom spaCy model for energy domain**
- Trained on 500+ energy storage regulatory documents
- Handles domain-specific terminology that generic models miss
- Recognizes technology variations: "iron-air" vs "iron-air battery" vs "metal-air storage"

**GPT-3 for disambiguation only**
- Cost control: Only use for complex extractions where rule-based fails
- Context understanding: Resolves "100 MW for 4 hours" → 100 MW power, 400 MWh energy
- Handles regulatory language variations across jurisdictions

**PostgreSQL over MongoDB**
- Energy project data is actually quite structured once normalized
- Regulatory reporting has consistent field requirements (even if terminology varies)
- SQL joins work better for market analysis queries

### **Domain-Specific Challenges Solved**

**Capacity Unit Normalization**
- Problem: Projects report MW, MWh, duration separately or combined
- Solution: Parse all variations and calculate missing values
- Example: "100 MW for 8 hours" → MW: 100, MWh: 800, Duration: 8

**Technology Classification**
- Problem: Same technology called different names by different companies
- Solution: Hierarchical matching with domain knowledge
- Example: "compressed air storage" → "Compressed air (CAES)"

**Company Name Standardization**
- Problem: "Form Energy Inc." vs "Form Energy" vs "Form" in different contexts
- Solution: Company name database with common variations
- Critical for tracking developer portfolios and market share analysis

**Timeline Disambiguation**
- Problem: "Announced 2023, operational 2025" vs "2025 project announcement"
- Solution: Context-aware date extraction with project lifecycle understanding
- Essential for pipeline forecasting and market timing analysis

## What I Learned About Energy Storage Data

### **Regulatory Filing Patterns**
- **FERC filings**: Most comprehensive but complex format, buried in legal language
- **State utility filings**: Vary significantly by jurisdiction, different disclosure requirements
- **International projects**: Different capacity units, regulatory frameworks
- **Press releases**: Marketing language, often missing technical details

### **Technology Naming Inconsistencies**
- "Battery storage" could mean li-ion OR long duration technologies
- "Grid-scale storage" tells you nothing about the actual technology
- "Energy storage system" is completely generic
- Need technology provider context to classify accurately

### **Market Intelligence Requirements**
- **Investment analysis**: Need capacity, timeline, financing details
- **Technology trends**: Track which LDES technologies are scaling
- **Geographic patterns**: Where is development concentrated and why
- **Supply chain mapping**: Developer → tech provider → EPC relationships

## Current Limitations & Next Steps

### **Immediate Fixes Needed**
- [ ] **International capacity units**: Handle MWe vs MW vs MWh variations across regions
- [ ] **FERC filing format**: Different structure than state regulatory filings
- [ ] **Technology provider disambiguation**: "ESS Inc." vs "Energy Storage Systems" confusion
- [ ] **Cost data extraction**: CAPEX figures buried in different sections of filings

### **Performance Optimization**
- [ ] **Large PDF processing**: Some regulatory filings are 100+ pages, slow to process
- [ ] **Batch API calls**: More efficient OpenAI usage for similar document types
- [ ] **Database indexing**: Optimize for market analysis query patterns

### **Market Analysis Features**
- [ ] **Real-time monitoring**: Watch for new regulatory filings automatically
- [ ] **Pipeline forecasting**: Aggregate announced capacity by quarter/region
- [ ] **Technology trend analysis**: Track which LDES technologies are gaining traction
- [ ] **Developer portfolio tracking**: Map project pipelines by company

## Technical Decisions Explained

**Why async processing?**
- Regulatory PDFs are large (10-50MB) and slow to download/process
- Need to handle 100+ documents efficiently for quarterly market updates
- Network I/O bound operations benefit significantly from concurrency

**Why custom spaCy training?**
- Generic NER models miss energy storage terminology consistently
- Domain-specific entities: "iron-air battery", "grid-scale storage", "long duration"
- Investment in training pays off with much higher extraction accuracy

**Why hybrid spaCy + GPT approach?**
- spaCy handles consistent patterns (project names, locations, basic capacity)
- GPT-3 tackles variable regulatory language and complex capacity specifications
- Cost optimization: only use expensive API for complex extractions

**Why PostgreSQL schema design?**
- Energy projects have consistent data structure despite document format variations
- Need efficient queries for market analysis (geographic aggregation, technology trends)
- Regulatory data has natural relationships (developer → projects, technology → providers)

## Market Context That Drives Development

**LDES market sizing**: $2.5B+ annually, growing rapidly with IRA incentives
**Data fragmentation**: No comprehensive commercial database covers early-stage projects
**Investment use case**: Need to track 200+ GWh capacity announcements quarterly
**Regulatory complexity**: Different disclosure requirements across 50+ jurisdictions

This pipeline enables market analysis that wasn't feasible with manual data collection:
- Geographic clustering patterns in LDES development
- Technology trend tracking across 19+ LDES categories
- Developer market share and pipeline analysis
- Capacity forecasting by quarter and technology type
