# LDES Market Intelligence Pipeline

## Why I Built This

After spending months manually tracking LDES project announcements across regulatory filings, press releases, and industry reports, I realized the energy storage sector desperately needed better data intelligence. When you're trying to analyze the $2.5B+ annual LDES market, manually parsing through FERC filings and state regulatory documents for project details doesn't scale.

**The core problem:** LDES project data is scattered across inconsistent sources that use wildly different terminology. A single project might be called "battery storage," "energy storage system," "grid-scale storage," or "long duration storage" depending on the source. Regulatory filings bury capacity specs in legal jargon, and international projects use different unit conventions (MW vs MWe vs MWh).

**What I needed:** A system that could intelligently extract structured data from the chaos of energy storage announcements, normalizing everything into a consistent format for investment analysis and market research.

## Technical Approach

This pipeline combines domain-trained NLP models with GPT-3's contextual understanding to handle the unique challenges of energy storage data extraction:

### **Hybrid Architecture for Energy Data**
- **Custom spaCy NER model**: Trained on 500+ LDES regulatory filings to handle energy-specific terminology
- **GPT-3 disambiguation**: Resolves regulatory language variations and complex capacity specifications  
- **Domain-specific post-processing**: Normalizes capacity units, standardizes company names, categorizes technologies

### **Why This Architecture for LDES?**
Energy storage filings have unique challenges that generic NLP can't handle:
- **Capacity confusion**: Projects report MW, MWh, and duration separately or combined
- **Technology variations**: "Iron-air battery" vs "iron-air" vs "long duration iron-air storage"
- **Regulatory complexity**: Different disclosure requirements across jurisdictions
- **Company naming**: "Form Energy Inc." vs "Form Energy" vs "Form" in different contexts

## Key Business Value

**Speed:** Process 100+ regulatory documents in minutes instead of days of manual review
**Consistency:** Standardized data schema across different regulatory formats and international sources  
**Completeness:** Capture early-stage projects that other databases miss (permitting filings, international announcements)
**Market Intelligence:** Enable analysis that wasn't feasible manually:
- Geographic clustering patterns in LDES development
- Technology trend tracking across the 19 LDES categories  
- Capacity pipeline forecasting by quarter and region

## Current Capabilities

### **Project Data Extraction**
- **Project specs**: Name, capacity (MW/MWh), duration, technology type, location
- **Timeline tracking**: Announced → Permitted → Construction → Operational dates
- **Market players**: Developer, technology provider, EPC contractor, financing sources
- **Technology categorization**: 19 LDES technology types (iron-air, liquid air, gravity, etc.)

### **Data Sources Handled**
- Regulatory filings (FERC, state utility commissions, international equivalents)
- Press releases and industry announcements  
- Technical reports and feasibility studies
- News articles and trade publication coverage

### **Processing Intelligence**
- Concurrent document processing with asyncio
- Capacity unit normalization (handles international variations)
- Company name standardization across different document formats
- Technology classification using domain-specific taxonomy

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Burton-David/ldes-data-pipeline.git
cd ldes-data-pipeline
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure for your environment
cp configs/config.yaml.example configs/config.yaml
# Add your OpenAI API key to .env file

# Run the pipeline
python main.py --config configs/config.yaml
```

## Configuration for LDES Analysis

The system uses domain-specific configurations in `configs/`:
- **`fields.json`**: 25+ LDES project fields (capacity, technology, timeline, players)
- **`categories.json`**: Real energy storage companies and technology taxonomies
- **`config.yaml`**: Processing parameters and database connections

Key settings for energy storage analysis:
```yaml
sectors:
  - ldes              # Long duration energy storage
  - geothermal        # Geothermal projects  
  - carbon_capture    # CCUS projects
  - green_steel       # Industrial decarbonization
```

## Architecture

```
Processing Pipeline:
Raw Documents → Text Extraction → NLP Analysis → Data Validation → PostgreSQL

Key Components:
├── Data Ingestion: Concurrent URL/PDF processing with energy-specific parsers
├── NER Pipeline: Custom spaCy model + GPT-3 for energy domain terminology  
├── Rule Engine: LDES-specific extraction rules for regulatory patterns
├── Validation: Energy storage data quality checks and unit normalization
└── Database: Structured storage optimized for energy project queries
```

## Technology Stack

**NLP/AI Stack:**
- Custom spaCy NER model (trained on energy storage regulatory filings)
- GPT-3.5-turbo for context-aware extraction and disambiguation
- PostgreSQL for structured energy project data
- asyncio for concurrent document processing

**Deployment:**
- Docker containerization with docker-compose
- Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for model updates
- YAML-based configuration for easy environment management

## Development Approach

This pipeline reflects iterative development based on real energy storage data challenges:

### **What I Learned Building This**
- Generic financial NER models miss energy-specific terminology consistently
- Regulatory filing structures vary significantly between jurisdictions  
- Capacity reporting inconsistencies are the biggest data quality challenge
- Technology categorization needs domain expertise (not just string matching)

### **Technical Decisions**
- **PostgreSQL over MongoDB**: Energy project data is actually quite structured
- **Custom spaCy model**: Generic models missed too many energy storage terms
- **GPT-3 for disambiguation only**: Cost control while maintaining accuracy
- **Async processing**: Regulatory PDFs are large and slow to process

## What's Next

**Immediate priorities:**
- [ ] Add FERC filing format support (different structure than state filings)
- [ ] International capacity unit handling (MWe vs MW vs MWh across regions)
- [ ] Enhanced technology classification for emerging LDES technologies

**Scaling plans:**
- [ ] Real-time monitoring of regulatory filing websites
- [ ] API for programmatic access to LDES market data
- [ ] Integration with energy market pricing data sources

## Impact & Usage

This pipeline enables analysis that wasn't feasible with manual data collection:
- **Investment research**: Track the $2.5B+ annual LDES market systematically
- **Technology trends**: Identify which storage technologies are scaling fastest
- **Geographic analysis**: Where is LDES development clustering and why?
- **Supply chain intelligence**: Map relationships between developers, tech providers, and financiers
